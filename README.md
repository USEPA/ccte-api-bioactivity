## Welcome to the GitHub repository for the CTX Bioactivity API

Originating from the US EPA's Center of Computational Toxicology and Exposure (CCTE), the CTX Bioactivity API is a RESTful API designed to manage and provide Bioactivity data. It interacts with a PostgreSQL database and offers various endpoints for hazard information. More information on the CTX API development and utility, as well as guidance on how to technically access and use them, is available here: https://www.epa.gov/comptox-tools/computational-toxicology-and-exposure-apis

- If you would like to report a bug or have other questions related to the CTX APIs, please contact the [CTX API Admins](mailto:ccte_api@epa.gov).
- If you are interested in contributing, please submit a issue or start a discussion. See [CONTRIBUTING](https://github.com/USEPA/ccte-api-bioactivity/blob/dev/CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information.

### Available Data
Data underlying the Bioactivity API comes from the US EPA's [Toxicity Forecaster (ToxCast)](https://www.epa.gov/comptox-tools/toxicity-forecasting-toxcast) invitrodb. ToxCast makes medium- and high-throughput bioactivity screening assay data publicly available for prioritization and hazard characterization.The ToxCast Pipeline utilizes open-source R packages ([tcpl](https://github.com/USEPA/CompTox-ToxCast-tcpl), [tcplfit2](https://github.com/USEPA/CompTox-ToxCast-tcplFit2), and [ctxR](https://github.com/USEPA/ctxr)) to store, manage, curve-fit, and visualize data and populate its relational database, invitrodb. Once data has been generated by various labs and processed, users can [explore ToxCast](https://www.epa.gov/comptox-tools/exploring-toxcast-data) via the [CompTox Chemicals Dashboard](https://www.epa.gov/comptox-tools/comptox-chemicals-dashboard), CTX APIs, and data downloads.    

### Technologies Used
- **Java**: Programming language used for the development of the application.
- **Spring Boot**: Framework used to create stand-alone, production-grade Spring-based applications.
- **Spring Data JPA**: Part of the Spring Data family, used to simplify data access and persistence.
- **Spring Data REST**: Used to expose Spring Data repositories as RESTful web services.
- **PostgreSQL**: Relational database used for storing bioactivity data.
- **Maven**: Build automation tool used for managing project dependencies and build lifecycle.
- **Lombok**: Java library used to reduce boilerplate code.
- **MapStruct**: Code generator used to simplify the implementation of mappings between Java bean types.
- **Swagger/OpenAPI**: Used for API documentation and testing.
- **Testcontainers**: Java library used for integration testing with Docker containers.

### Configuration
The application configuration is managed through YAML files. The main configuration file is `application.yml`, and environment-specific configurations are in files like `application-local.yml`.

### Build and Deployment
The project uses Maven for build and deployment processes. Continuous integration and deployment can be set up using tools like GitHub Actions.

### Getting Started
To build and run the project locally, use the following Maven commands:

```sh
mvn clean install
mvn spring-boot:run
```
